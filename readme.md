# UFO Crisis 20XX
An old-school vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up, made in Lua & LÖVE. This was created as my final project for CS50, completed in May 2020.

Features keyboard controls, collision detection,
background scrolling, score tracking & high score recording, 
a seperate boss section at the end, a 'true final boss' that
only appears if you meet certain requirements, and
2 different endings.

Soundtrack composed in Dezaemon SFC for authentic
Super Nintendo vibes.


## How to use

You'll need the [LÖVE](https://github.com/love2d/love "Love GitHub") framework.


## Notes

Code could be tidier, but it's my first Lua game, and it at least works (pretty much) as intended. I've been tinkering with an improved version that uses gamestates, an entity component system & has improved collision detection, but who knows if that will ever be finished?

Yes, that is my cat at the end.
